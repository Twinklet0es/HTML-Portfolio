<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have always been a design and programming enthusiast, but have found myself doing anything but coding in my life. My avoidance of doing what I actually love has seen me admitted to the bar as a barrister and solicitor, working in New Zealand's parliament as a reporter, teaching primary aged children in Istanbul, building a tiny house in Wellington and setting up a homestead in Wairarapa, New Zealand's wine country. </p>
