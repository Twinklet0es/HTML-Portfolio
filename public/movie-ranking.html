<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time If By All Time You Mean Right Now</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. Sean of the Dead</h3>
<p>A fast-moving splatter film with a wonderfully crafted storyline. I've watched this at least five times, and it's always entertaining.</p>
<h3>2. Into the Wild</h3>
<p>A deeply engaging story about a young man's struggles to come to terms with society, and his subsequent journey into the Alaskan wilderness. The soundtrack by Eddy Vedder is sparse and beautiful.</p>
<h3>3. Labyrinth</h3>
<p>Once you get over David Bowie's weird dancing, this movie is an entertaining watch. Made before CGI graphics made anything possible, Jim Henson's puppetry in this film is inventive and nothing short of genius.</p>
